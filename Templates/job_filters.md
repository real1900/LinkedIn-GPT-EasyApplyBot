# About this document
On this document, explain the rules to filter through job postings. 

Both `# Job Title Filters` and `# Job Description Filters` sections, must be included on the document, these names are hardcoded on the script __do not modify them__.

The `# Job Title Filters` section is used to filter the job title, and the `# Job Description Filters` section is used to filter the job description, once the job passes the job title filtering. The information on these sections is used on different steps of the process, you can have different rules on each section, or the same rules on both sections.

# Job Title Filters
I'm looking for jobs that are close to (but not exclusively): Senior Developer, Frontend Developer, IOS Developer, Android Developer, Mobile Architect, iOS Architect ,iOS Tech Lead, iOS Engineer. Other roles similar to these are also acceptable.

Also, I'm not interested in junior positions, I'm looking for a mid-level position or higher.

Also, there are some industries I'm not interested in: insurance and healthcare.

I'm not interested in junior positions. I'm looking for a mid-level positions or higher.

I seek responsibilities that are close to (but not exclusively): mobile application development. Similar responsibilities are acceptable for iOS and Android. Also MacOS development, FLutter Development and React Native Development is fine.

Ideal roles are those where mobile apps development knowledge is required, as well as, experience on agile methodologies, and startup experience. A job not meeting these requirements is still acceptable.

I'm not interested on certain sectors as insurance and healthcare.
